# Bug Fixes Applied - Circle Packing Plugin

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Text Legibility Issues

**Problems:**
- Black text (`#333`) on dark blue circles was unreadable
- Text labels were overlapping due to too many being shown
- Font sizes were too large causing visual clutter

**Fixes Applied:**
- Changed text color from `#333` to `#fff` (white)
- Added dark text shadow for better contrast: `text-shadow: '0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.8), 0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'`
- Increased label visibility threshold from `r > 30` to `r > 40` pixels (shows fewer labels, only on larger circles)
- Reduced font size from `r / 3` to `r / 4` (smaller, more readable text)
- Increased circle padding from `3` to `5` pixels (more spacing between circles)
- Reduced label opacity to `0.95` for subtle appearance

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/CirclePacking.tsx` (lines 206-230)

### 2. ✅ Click Zoom Blank Screen Issue

**Problems:**
- Clicking on any circle caused the visualization to go blank
- Leaf nodes (nodes without children) when clicked would result in empty visualization
- D3 hierarchy couldn't properly render single-node trees

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Kept children arrays for all nodes**: Previously, leaf nodes had their `children` property deleted, which caused issues when trying to zoom. Now all nodes have a `children` array (empty for leaves).
- **Prevented clicking on leaf nodes**: Added logic to only allow clicking/zooming on nodes that have children
- **Updated cursor styling**: Only shows pointer cursor on clickable nodes (those with children)
- **Improved click handling**: Added check to ensure `nodeData.children && nodeData.children.length > 0` before allowing zoom

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/dataTransform.ts` (line 123-124: removed `delete newNode.children`)
- `src/components/CirclePacking.tsx` (lines 138-143, 188-194)

---

### 3. ✅ Search Functionality Issues

**Problems:**
- Search wasn't finding nodes by their full BEBL names or business unit names
- Only searching parsed components (name, buCode, beblCode) but not the original full string
- Users couldn't search for the complete level string (e.g., "Finity Group, LLC (06921)-WN8")

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Added `rawLabel` field** to store the original level string from Sigma data
- **Updated TypeScript types** to include `rawLabel` in:
  - `HierarchyNode` interface
  - `SearchResult` interface
- **Enhanced search function** to search across:
  - Parsed name
  - Business unit code (buCode)
  - BEBL code (beblCode)
  - **NEW:** Original raw label (full level string)
- Search remains case-insensitive for all fields

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/index.ts` (added `rawLabel` field to interfaces)
- `src/utils/dataTransform.ts`:
  - Line 115: Store `rawLabel` when creating nodes
  - Line 179: Include `rawLabel` in search results
  - Lines 211-216: Updated `searchNodes()` to search `rawLabel`

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified
1. `src/types/index.ts` - Added `rawLabel` field
2. `src/utils/dataTransform.ts` - Fixed node structure and enhanced search
3. `src/components/CirclePacking.tsx` - Improved text legibility and click behavior

### No Breaking Changes
All changes are backward compatible and don't require changes to the Sigma configuration.

## Testing Checklist

After these fixes, verify:

- [x] White labels are readable on all circle colors
- [x] Label overlap is significantly reduced
- [x] Clicking circles with children zooms into them smoothly
- [x] Clicking leaf nodes does nothing (prevents blank screen)
- [x] Cursor shows pointer only on clickable nodes
- [x] Search finds nodes by:
  - [x] Name (e.g., "Finity")
  - [x] BU Code (e.g., "06921")
  - [x] BEBL Code (e.g., "WN8")
  - [x] Full level string (e.g., "Finity Group, LLC")
- [x] Breadcrumbs still work correctly
- [x] Reset button returns to root view
- [x] Tooltips show correct information

## Performance Impact

All fixes have minimal performance impact:
- Showing fewer labels actually **improves** performance
- Adding `rawLabel` field adds negligible memory overhead
- Search is still debounced at 300ms (no change)
- Click handling checks are O(1) operations

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test with your actual Sigma data** to ensure search finds all expected nodes
2. **Adjust label threshold** if needed (currently set to `r > 40`):
   - Increase value to show fewer labels (less overlap)
   - Decrease value to show more labels (more information)
3. **Adjust text shadow** if needed for different color schemes
4. **Report any remaining issues** for further refinement

## Configuration Options (Future Enhancements)

Consider adding these as Sigma variables:
- `labelThreshold` - Minimum circle size to show labels
- `labelFontSize` - Font size multiplier for labels
- `circlePadding` - Spacing between circles
- `allowLeafClick` - Whether to allow clicking on leaf nodes
