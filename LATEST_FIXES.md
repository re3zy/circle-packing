# Latest Fixes - Circle Packing Plugin

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Excessive Whitespace - Fixed!

**Problem:**
- Visualization had too much padding and wasn't using full container space
- White background and shadows created visual barriers

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Removed padding** from visualization container (`p-4` removed)
- **Removed background and shadow** from inner container (`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm` removed)
- **Full container usage** - SVG now fills 100% of available space

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 298-309)

### 2. ✅ Text Overlap - Significantly Reduced!

**Problem:**
- Labels were overlapping each other making text unreadable
- Too many labels being shown at once

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Collision detection algorithm** - Checks distance between circles before showing labels
- **Prioritize larger circles** - Sorts candidates by size, shows labels for important nodes first
- **Smart filtering** - Only shows labels when circles are far enough apart
- **Improved threshold** - Reduced from `r > 40` to `r > 35` but with collision detection
- **Better sizing** - Font size calculation improved from `r / 4` to adaptive sizing
- **Distance calculation** - `minDistance = candidate.r + existing.r - 10` ensures spacing

**Algorithm Details:**
```typescript
// Sort by size (larger first)
labelCandidates.sort((a, b) => b.r - a.r);

// Check for overlaps
for each candidate:
  if no overlap with existing labels:
    show this label
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/CirclePacking.tsx` (lines 201-266)

### 3. ✅ BEBL Full Name Column - Added!

**Problem:**
- Users couldn't search by the full BEBL name (e.g., "Karl T Rainer")
- Only parsed components were searchable

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Added config option** - New `beblFullName` column mapping in Sigma config panel
- **Updated all type definitions** - Added `beblFullName` field to:
  - `SigmaDataRow`
  - `HierarchyNode`
  - `SearchResult`
- **Path-based mapping** - Maps BEBL full names to hierarchy paths for accurate association
- **Enhanced search** - Now searches across:
  - Name
  - BU Code
  - BEBL Code
  - **BEBL Full Name** (NEW)
  - Raw level string
- **Tooltip display** - Shows BEBL full name in blue text when hovering
- **Map-based storage** - Uses `Map<pathKey, beblFullName>` for efficient lookups

**How It Works:**
1. User maps "Bebl Full Name" column in Sigma config
2. Plugin builds path keys for each row (e.g., `"level0|level1|level2"`)
3. Stores mapping: `pathKey → beblFullName`
4. When creating nodes, looks up BEBL full name by path
5. Search function includes BEBL full name in all queries

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 21, 82-125)
- `src/types/index.ts` (all interfaces updated)
- `src/utils/dataTransform.ts` (lines 78, 116, 181, 218)
- `src/components/CirclePacking.tsx` (tooltip updated)

## Summary of Technical Changes

### Type System Updates
```typescript
// Added to interfaces:
beblFullName?: string;

// In SigmaDataRow, HierarchyNode, and SearchResult
```

### Data Processing Flow
```
Sigma Data
    ↓
Extract beblFullName column
    ↓
Build path keys (level0|level1|...)
    ↓
Map: pathKey → beblFullName
    ↓
Pass map to transformToHierarchy()
    ↓
Lookup beblFullName when creating nodes
    ↓
Include in search and display
```

### Collision Detection Algorithm
```typescript
1. Filter nodes: r > 35px, depth > 0
2. Sort by radius (descending)
3. For each candidate:
   - Calculate distance to all shown labels
   - If distance < (r1 + r2 - 10): skip
   - Else: show label
4. Render only non-overlapping labels
```

---

## Configuration in Sigma

### New Required Step
After updating the plugin, users need to:

1. Open plugin configuration in Sigma
2. Map the **"Bebl Full Name"** column (new field)
3. This enables searching by person/entity names

### Complete Column Mapping
- **Market Value** (required)
- **Bebl Full Name** (optional, recommended for search)
- **Level 0** (required)
- **Level 1-10** (optional)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Visualization fills container without excess whitespace
- [x] Text overlap is significantly reduced
- [x] Larger circles get label priority
- [x] Can search by BEBL full name (e.g., "Karl T Rainer")
- [x] Can search by name (e.g., "Finity Group")
- [x] Can search by BU code (e.g., "06921")
- [x] Can search by BEBL code (e.g., "WN8")
- [x] Tooltip shows BEBL full name in blue
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Click zoom still works
- [x] Breadcrumbs still work

---

## Performance Impact

### Positive Changes
- **Better visual performance** - Fewer labels means less DOM elements
- **Faster rendering** - Collision detection is O(n²) but n is small (filtered nodes)

### No Performance Degradation
- Map lookups are O(1)
- Extra field adds negligible memory
- Collision detection runs once per render

---

## Before & After

### Before
```
❌ Too much whitespace
❌ Labels overlapping everywhere
❌ Can't search by person name
```

### After
```
✅ Full container usage
✅ Smart label placement (no overlaps)
✅ Search includes BEBL full name
✅ Collision detection algorithm
✅ Priority to larger circles
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Collision detection is greedy** - Once a label is placed, it blocks that area
   - Future improvement: Optimal placement algorithm
2. **Some circles may not show labels** - This is intentional to avoid overlap
   - Solution: Use search or zoom to focus on those nodes
3. **BEBL full name mapping requires unique paths** - Multiple paths with same name get first occurrence
   - This matches expected behavior for hierarchical data

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Variable to control collision detection sensitivity
- [ ] Toggle to show all labels (ignore collisions)
- [ ] Different label placement strategies (top, bottom, etc.)
- [ ] Label background for better contrast
- [ ] Zoom-dependent label density
