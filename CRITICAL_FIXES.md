# Critical Fixes - Container Sizing, Search, and Blank Screen Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Container Sizing - FIXED!

**Problem:**
- Plugin wasn't filling the container properly
- Circles appeared too small or off-center
- Whitespace around visualization

**Root Cause:**
- Flexbox layout wasn't properly constraining child elements
- Dimensions calculated before DOM was ready
- Missing `minHeight: 0` on flex children (critical flexbox issue)

**Fixes Applied:**

#### Container Layout
```css
/* Parent container */
overflow: hidden (prevents scroll)

/* Viz container */
flex-1 (takes remaining space)
minHeight: 0 (CRITICAL for flexbox to respect parent)
overflow: hidden (prevents internal scroll)
```

#### Dimension Calculation
- Added `setTimeout(100ms)` for initial render (ensures DOM ready)
- Uses `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` (more accurate than clientWidth)
- Fallback to `clientWidth/clientHeight`
- Minimum dimensions: 400x400 (prevents collapse)

#### SVG Sizing
```css
display: block (removes inline spacing)
maxWidth: 100% (respects container)
maxHeight: 100% (respects container)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 45-67, 273, 326)
- `src/components/CirclePacking.tsx` (line 272, 277)

### 2. ✅ BEBL Search Inconsistency - FIXED!

**Problem:**
- Searching for BEBL full name sometimes worked, sometimes didn't
- Same person name would find some nodes but not others

**Root Cause:**
The BEBL full name was only being stored for the LAST level in each row's path:

```typescript
// OLD (BUGGY) CODE:
if (!beblFullNameMap.has(pathKey)) {
  beblFullNameMap.set(pathKey, row.beblFullName);
}
// This only set the name once, missing intermediate levels!
```

**Example of the Bug:**
```
Row has path: Level0 → Level1 → Level2
BEBL Name: "Michael F Merrill"

OLD behavior:
  ✓ Level0|Level1|Level2 → "Michael F Merrill" (stored)
  ✗ Level0 → (not stored)
  ✗ Level0|Level1 → (not stored)

Result: Search for "Michael" only finds Level2 nodes, not Level0 or Level1!
```

**Fix Applied:**
Store BEBL full name for **ALL levels** in the path:

```typescript
// NEW (FIXED) CODE:
for (const level of levels) {
  if (!level) break;
  pathParts.push(level);
  const pathKey = pathParts.join('|');
  // Store for ALL path combinations
  beblFullNameMap.set(pathKey, row.beblFullName);
}
```

**Now Works:**
```
Row has path: Level0 → Level1 → Level2
BEBL Name: "Michael F Merrill"

NEW behavior:
  ✓ Level0 → "Michael F Merrill"
  ✓ Level0|Level1 → "Michael F Merrill"
  ✓ Level0|Level1|Level2 → "Michael F Merrill"

Result: Search for "Michael" finds ALL nodes at any level! ✓
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 112-128)

### 3. ✅ Blank Screen on Search Click - FIXED!

**Problem:**
- Clicking a search result sometimes made the plugin go blank
- Especially when clicking on leaf nodes (bottom-level entities)

**Root Cause:**
Search was zooming into **any** node, including leaf nodes (nodes without children). When you zoom into a leaf node, D3 tries to render just that one circle with no children → blank screen.

**Fix Applied:**
Check if node has children BEFORE zooming:

```typescript
// Find the actual node
const foundNode = findNode(hierarchyData, result.path);
if (!foundNode) return;

// CRITICAL CHECK: Only zoom if node has children
if (foundNode.children && foundNode.children.length > 0) {
  setFocusedPath(result.path);  // Zoom in
  setBreadcrumbs(trail);
} else {
  // Leaf node - do nothing, stay at current view
}
```

**Behavior Now:**
- **Parent node clicked** → Zooms in to show subtree ✓
- **Leaf node clicked** → Stays at current view (no blank screen) ✓
- **Search still highlights** the node in results
- **Hover tooltip** still works on all nodes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 185-231)

## Technical Details

### Flexbox Container Fix

The key CSS rule that fixes container sizing:

```css
.flex-1 {
  min-height: 0; /* CRITICAL! */
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Flexbox children default to `min-height: auto`
- This prevents them from shrinking below content size
- Setting `min-height: 0` allows them to be constrained by parent
- Without this, the SVG doesn't properly fill the space

### BEBL Name Path Mapping

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
Map<pathKey, beblFullName>

Examples:
"Level0" → "Michael F Merrill"
"Level0|Level1" → "Michael F Merrill"
"Level0|Level1|Level2" → "Michael F Merrill"
```

**Why Store All Levels:**
Each level in the hierarchy is a separate node. When building the tree, we look up the BEBL name by path. If we only stored the deepest path, intermediate nodes wouldn't have the name.

### Search Click Safety

**Decision Tree:**
```
User clicks search result
    ↓
Find node in hierarchy
    ↓
Does node have children?
    ├─ YES → Zoom to node (safe)
    └─ NO → Do nothing (prevent blank screen)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Container Sizing
- [x] Plugin fills full Sigma container
- [x] No excess whitespace around circles
- [x] Circles are properly centered
- [x] Resizing window updates visualization
- [x] Works on different screen sizes

### BEBL Search
- [x] Search "Michael" finds all Michael nodes
- [x] Search "Finity" finds all Finity nodes
- [x] Search works at Level 0
- [x] Search works at Level 1, 2, 3+
- [x] Search results show all matching nodes
- [x] Partial name search works (e.g., "Mich" finds "Michael")

### Blank Screen Prevention
- [x] Clicking parent nodes zooms correctly
- [x] Clicking leaf nodes doesn't cause blank screen
- [x] Search results for leaf nodes don't break plugin
- [x] Can still hover tooltips on leaf nodes
- [x] Breadcrumbs work correctly

## Migration Notes

**No Configuration Changes Required!**
- All fixes are internal to the plugin
- Existing Sigma configurations work as-is
- BEBL Full Name column mapping still optional

**Behavior Changes:**
1. **Search is now comprehensive** - Finds BEBL names at all levels
2. **Leaf nodes are non-zoomable** - Prevents blank screen
3. **Better container filling** - Uses full available space

---

## Performance Impact

- **BEBL Name Storage:** Slightly more memory (storing name for each level)
  - Trade-off: Complete search coverage vs. minimal memory increase
  - Impact: Negligible (strings are small, modern browsers handle this easily)

- **Search Click Check:** One additional check per click
  - Impact: Negligible (O(1) operation)

- **Container Sizing:** More accurate dimension calculation
  - Impact: Positive (better initial render, fewer reflows)

---

## Known Edge Cases

1. **Multiple people with same BEBL name:**
   - Each node path gets the name from its row
   - If same person appears in multiple rows, later rows overwrite
   - This is expected behavior (same person, same name)

2. **Very deep hierarchies (10+ levels):**
   - All levels get BEBL name stored
   - No performance issue (Map lookups are O(1))

3. **Leaf nodes in search results:**
   - Will appear in results but won't zoom when clicked
   - User can still see them in tooltips and visualization
   - This is intentional to prevent blank screen

---

## Debugging Tips

If issues persist:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify BEBL Full Name column** is mapped in Sigma config
3. **Try searching for partial names** (e.g., "Mich" instead of "Michael F Merrill")
4. **Use browser DevTools** to inspect SVG dimensions
5. **Check if nodes have children** by hovering and checking tooltip
